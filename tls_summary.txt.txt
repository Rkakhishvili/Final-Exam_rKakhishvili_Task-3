TLS maintains confidentiality by encrypting all data sent between the client and the Server via employing symmetric encryption methods such as AES. Even if someone intercepts the traffic, they will be unable to decipher the information. Data integrity is ensured by using Message Authentication Codes or Encryption, such as AES, as these measures include a cryptographic hash in each communication. If even a single bit is modified during transmission, the recipient will notice it and reject the message, confirming that the data has not been tampered with.
